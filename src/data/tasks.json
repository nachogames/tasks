If people could export their lists to markdown or json or whatever then I don't see why that would be much of an issue. a v-model right from the object does this save to it? if so. woah\n\nFor the mobile area I really want to try and do what is done witht he git journal app I am using. It is able to set up an ssh key for a specific repo and then I can manually refresh from there.
